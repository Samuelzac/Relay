    <p class="muted">Last updated: <span id="d"></span></p>

    <div class="card">
      <p class="strong">Important:</p>
      <p>You are solely responsible for any content you broadcast using this platform. The platform operator does not create, curate, monitor, control, or approve streamed content and is not the publisher of any stream.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. What we provide</h2>
    <p>This platform provides short-lived live streaming infrastructure (broadcast + playback links). We are a technical service provider only.</p>

    <h2>2. No content responsibility</h2>
    <p>All streams are created and controlled by the host. We do not review, edit, or supervise streams. You agree that the platform operator is not responsible or liable for streamed content, including any claims relating to copyright, defamation, privacy, harassment, or unlawful material.</p>

    <h2>3. Host responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You confirm you own or have all rights, licences, and permissions required to broadcast your content.</li>
      <li>You confirm you have obtained all necessary consents from people who appear in the stream (including audio).</li>
      <li>You will comply with all applicable laws and third‑party platform rules.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for any viewer access you share (links, passwords, secrets).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Prohibited use</h2>
    <p>You must not use the platform to stream or facilitate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copyright infringement or unauthorised rebroadcasting</li>
      <li>Illegal activity or instructions to commit illegal activity</li>
      <li>Child sexual exploitation material (immediate termination + reporting)</li>
      <li>Hate speech, threats, or incitement to violence</li>
      <li>Fraud, scams, or deceptive conduct</li>
      <li>Material that violates privacy or confidentiality obligations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Enforcement and termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend, disable, or terminate any event or stream immediately (with or without notice) if we reasonably believe it breaches these Terms or could create legal or safety risk. If we disable service for breach, you are not entitled to a refund.</p>

    <h2>6. Reports</h2>
    <p>Viewers may report a stream. We may act on reports at our discretion. We may preserve and share relevant logs with law enforcement where required or reasonably necessary.</p>

    <h2>7. Service availability</h2>
    <p>The service is provided <span class="strong">“as is”</span> and <span class="strong">“as available”</span>. We do not guarantee uninterrupted streaming, compatibility with any device, or that viewers will be able to connect.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the platform operator is not liable for any indirect, consequential, or reputational loss. Our total liability for any claim is limited to the amount you paid for the specific event that gave rise to the claim.</p>

    <h2>9. Indemnity</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the platform operator from any claims, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from your stream, your content, or your breach of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by New Zealand law.</p>

    <p class="muted">If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the platform.</p>
